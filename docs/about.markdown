This is the blog of Peter Szilvasi, who lives in an embarrassingly small country, Hungary.
Fascinated by science and technology while pondering about the meaning of life.
I love talking about the source code of the universe.
I would like to think that I am good at building things using computers.
Joking until it is not funny anymore is also my superpower.
For me, no sport can leave my heart, be it: tennis, wall climbing, calisthenics, volleyball, badminton, balancing on slack line, or even playing chess.
