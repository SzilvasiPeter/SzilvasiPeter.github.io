Welcome, Dear Blog!

I have always found it really hard to express my thought, especially when I am talking. As neurons are firing in my brain, thoughts and ideas pop swiftly from the unconscious to the conscious mind. That's why talking - for some individuals like me - is increasingly harder. I make mistakes more frequently. I spit out nonsense without notice. I can not find the right words and the list goes on. However, writing is different. It is less hectic, much slower, much deliberate. Therefore, it can be *less fun*, but my intention here is to express my thoughts and feelings. If you have seen the anime series name [Violet Evergarden](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7078180/) then you know how much important to **write** about one's feelings because it is not easy to get a sense of this world.

When babies are born, they try to organize these colorful pixels on the retina, called an image, or the seemingly ordered air vibrations, called a sound. As they grow up, they need to be *fine-tuned* by their parents and by the community. Fundamentally, the reason why we are so different from monkeys - despite the fact that our genetics are VERY similar - is because we are granted a lot of time to grow up. For instance, most animals learn to walk [within hours](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/take-year-human-babies-walk-animals-walk-much-sooner.html) while infants takes 14 months. Humans are very fortunate, since most of us do not need to worry about dying from a predator. Having said that, newborn animals are *quite grown* regarding their brain. On the human side, children start almost with a blank state, [tabula rasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa). It results in an immense diversity of personhood, from introvert to extrovert, from sociopaths to angels, from Hitler to Gandhi.

"The very First Blog" post ends now. I do not know where this blogging journey will take me. I only know that sharing experience through language is shaped our existence. Furthermore, I also know that words, sounds, images are **inefficient** to transfer one's emotions and thoughts perfectly. At the end of the day, they are just symbols... Powerful Symbols.
