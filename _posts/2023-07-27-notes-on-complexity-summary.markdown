This is my summary of the [Notes on Complexity: A Scientific Theory of Connection, Consciousness, and Being](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Complexity-Scientific-Connection-Consciousness/dp/1954118252) book by Neil Theise.

## Introduction

- The author had a several interests through out his lifetime. Started with mathematics and followed by biology and computer science. Later, philosophy and religion got his attention as well.
- He met with a girl who was fascinated in complexity theory. She was amazed by the emergent property of the [TechoSphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechnoSphere_(virtual_environment)) game. It is a real-time simulation, governed by set of rules and algorithms. The game was capable to model concepts such as evolution.
- The interaction between Neil and the girl set the stage for the investigation of complexity.

# I. Complexity

## Science of Being

> "The whole system is greater than the sum of its parts."

- Complexity arises anywhere from deep seas to the Himalaya, but its origin still a mystery.
- Complexity != Complicated, rather the simple parts of a system interact with each other and that give rise to an *evolving*, *adaptive*, and *self-sustaining* properties.
- The newly created properties from the interactions called **emergence**.
- Complexity goes beyond humans and biology. It also applies to technology, chemistry and physics.
- General relativity and Quantum mechanics cannot describe how basic elements transform into complex system. According to [computational irreducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibility), it may be inevitable.
- As babies, we were born as whole. Later, we identify with "I" inside and "the World" outside.
- Humans drawn to the feeling of unity, still busy finding the oness of the world.
- Complexity theory can provide deep insights about how to *be one with all*.

## Order, Chaos and the Origin of Complexity

> "Like our world. Like our life."

- Complexity theory (CT) arose in the 1960s. Before then, the reductionist view was the following: you understand a system by breaking into its pieces and understanding them one by one.
- Complexity theory tells a different story. It is a study of how the individual parts combine/self-organize with each other to make a system. CT reverse the process: `parts -> system` instead of `system -> parts`
- 1st System Class: Precisely Predictable
    - These systems obey to simple equations.
    - For example, fluid mechanics can describe statistically without knowing every single water molecule.
- 2nd System Class: Chaotic System
- Fractals: The Mathematics of Chaos
    - Benoit Mandelbrot expanded our knowledge of chaos theory in 1975.
    - Fractals geometries are present in nature, for instance romansco broccoli, branching rivers, forks of lighting.
    - Fractals in nature reach a limit, yet mathematically we can go on forever. The [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) has no limit to its ever-unfolding characteristic.
    - It is hard to summarize them in a compact equation, for this reason, computers enter into the study of complexity.
- 3rd System Class: Living Organism
    - It is insufficient to describe the living system like the lung, heart, brain by equations. Therefore, scientists apply complex theory.
- Game of Life
    - Christopher Langton (a young hippie and a self-taught programmer) was amazed by the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automaton.
    - It was created by John Conway. The Game of Life is a 2D grid of squares that are living (black square) or dead (white square) depending on the number of living or dead squares around them.
    - Langton realized that cells on the monitor and the cars on the street are both living, are both similar, not different in any kind.
    - He embarked on the path of CT and recognized that is all about the *evolution of the information*. He called the generated pattern by the computer: artificial life.
- Life at the Edge of Chaos
    - Stephan Wolfram came into the game to research the field of complexity further. He identifies (as Langton and John von Neumann did independently) a 4th class, the phase transition.
    - [Phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) is where chaos and stability pull in opposite direction.
    - The four distinct classes are the *Frozen*, the *Blinking*, the *Chaotic*, and the *Complex* class.
    - While chaos theory describes the previously indescribable, the complex theory describes life itself.
    - The models of complexity mimic living things, from ant colonies to global ecosystem.
    - Phase transition between water and ice and steam are depicted as simple lines but looking closely at the boundary reveals the edge of chaos.
    - If you look at trees, fungi, chemicals, insects, humans, then you will see complexity.
    - The adaptations drive evolution toward increasingly more computational capabilities, biological system thereby seem to evolve between order and disorder. Because the information transmission and processing is most effective at [critical point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics)). Evolution leads to complexity.
    - Stuart Kauffman argues best about complexity theory in his "The Origin of Order" book.
    - He went further than Darwin and constructed models (Boolean networks, autocatalytic sets) that explained how life is originated.
- [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) and Unpredictability
    - Unlike traditional theories, complexity and chaos can be explored by computer simulations. Through simulation, new properties emerge magically.
    - Emergence in chaotic system: The whole is *predictably* greater than its parts. If the butterfly flaps its wings the same way, it results with the same tornado.
    - Emergence in complex system: The whole is *unpredictably* greater than its parts. We can predict that emergence will occur, but cannot predict its precise nature, even if we start with the same initial conditions.

## Rules of Complexity and the Adjacent Possible

> "Life is ceasless movoment; stability found in balance, not in rigidity."

> "Explosive growth ensues, followed by utter collapse"

> "Unpredictibality is the defining hallmark of complex systems."

> "Stability and chaos tug at life from either side."

> "Death cleans the way for more extraordinary, unpredictable life. And isn't there more to life than just staying alive? What about the meaning of being part of a larger, ever-evolving whole?"

- Everywhere you look, you see complexity. We are part of it. Let's look at ants!
- Numbers matter. A few ants do not give rise to complexity, they did not create tunnels, food lines, bury their dead and so on.
- **Interactions are local**, not global. The queen ant does not micromanage from top-down, she only reproduces. They produce/communicate using pheromones. Food line is created without any plan.
- Authoritarian regimes practice the illusion of global control.
- Similarly, the brain does not monitor everything. It is part of the beautifully complex web of the human body with the endocrine system, the digestive track, the vascular system, ...
- [Negative Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback) Loops Prevail
    - Negative loop: If the environment is too warm, then the air conditioner cools it down. If the environment is too cold, then the air conditioner warms it up.
    - Positive loop: If the global temperatures rise, then Arctic ice begins to melt. As the ice melts, it exposes more dark ocean water. It absorbs more sunlight than reflective ice, leading to increased warming of the water.
    - Negative feedback loops are common to reach [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis), balanced state. Like, ant scents reinforce each other, but it fades away as time goes by.
    - All living systems are homeostatic.
    - If the positive feedback loop overtake, then equilibrium vanishes. For example, economic bubble or cancer cell.
    - Uncontrolled growth of cancer cell can be cured by resetting the immune system, the homeostasis, the negative feedback loop.
    - On the smaller scale (atom, quantum) is easier to convey the feedback loops, mathematically speaking.
- The Degree of [Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness) is Key
    - Too much randomness prevents self-organization, too less randomness causes *machine-like* behavior.
    - A little randomness (just the right amount) opens the door for adjacent possibilities. That is why complex systems differ, even with the same initial starting point.
    - While a cell talks differently to other cell than a quark talks to another quark, each of them has its own emergent properties. Different level, different communication.
- What makes us alive necessitates that we will die!

# II. Complementarity and Holarchy - Or the Boundless Body

## The Cellular Level: Our Bodies, Our Cells

> "Complex system can be composed of other complex system."

> "Opposites are complementary."

- Everything is made by smaller part, cells. The same kind of cell differ from each other, they exhibit *diversity within the uniformity*.
- Cells self-organize, communication is local, interaction is a little random.
- Whether you see a "thing" or "phenomenon" depends on the scale and on the point of view.
- [Complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity)
    - Is our body unitary or a phenomenon arising? Both, equally and unequally.
    - By the same token, light is both a wave and a particle in quantum physics. The [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) shows the wave-particle duality.
    - It is impossible to capture both state at the same time, hence they are complementary.
    - Niels Bohr saw complementarity as a **fundamental property** at every scale. Bohr has a symbol on his arm to remind himself: "Opposites are complementary."
- Where is your Boundary Now?
    - Touch and feel your finger. It contains dead skin cells and on top of it, bacteria. These bacteria are called microbiome, fellow travel companions who keep us alive.
    - Bodies 50% cell are [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome). We give to them, we get from them, a nice [symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis).
    - Think of your body today, yesterday, when you were a teenager, baby, fetus, fertilized egg, unfertilized egg, the egg of mother's, Homo Erectus, multi-cell, Eukaryote, single-cell, ...
    - We are all a single organism in the continuation of space and time. Meaning, we are independent individuals, yet dependent on one organism.

## The Molecular Level: Beyond the Cell Doctrine

- The cell was a philosophical question in ancient time. The debate was discrete or continuous, atom or fluid. *Again a complementarity!*
- For example, acupuncture is proven its positive health effect, yet we cannot explain by the discrete cell doctrine, but the fluid doctrine provides a useful insight.
- The Fluid Body
    - Cells float in fluid where nutrients and molecular waste are present.
    - Cell membrane, either water-soluble or fat soluble.
    - Warmer temperature leads to more kinetic energy, which then leads to more [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion).
- Bodies are not Machines
    - Muscle movement involves Actin, Myosin, ATP, and water.
    - It is not a molecular machine because water interaction is random.
    - Temperature and Brownian molecule motion affect the cell interactions.
- Consider a man living in the forest. He is self-sufficient, he gathers food from the forest, he disposes his wastes (CO2, urine, feces), wastes are recycled by other organisms that live in the forest
- The same **cycle** can be found in the cities, in everyday **life**.

## The Atomic Level: Gaia

> "Over the last 3.5 billion years, the atoms of Earth are organizing themselves to reach the atoms of Mars."

- Atoms (just like molecules) are self-organized. Sugar $C_6H_{12}O_6$, oxygen $O_2$, water $H_2O$, fat $CH_3(CH_2)_nCOOH$, protein $RCH(NH_2)COOH$
- Atoms fulfill the criteria for complex system: positive/negative feedback loop, local interaction, randomness.
- Molecules (therefore atoms) return to nature. An **endless recycling** and replacement. Hence, we are in fact the Earth itself. Life and Death are a series of transformations.
- [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) considers the planet as a single organism.
- Organic and inorganic components act as a single, self-regulating, living system. They are *not separated*, they are complementary.

## The Subatomic Level: Quantum Strangeness

> "I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."

- Atoms made of subatomic particles: proton, neutron. Subatomic particle composed of 30 elementary particles: electron, lepton, quark, gluon neutrino, Higgs boson, ...
- Photon/Electron has a wavelike nature. Toss 2 pebbles on a pool of water.
- Constructive interference `~ + ~ = 2*~`; reinforcement likewise positive feedback loop
- Reconstructive interference `^ + ˘ = -`; cancellation likewise negative feedback loop
- If electron observed by detectors, then there is no wave pattern.
- Particle-wavelike property depends on how we observe them.
- Erwin Schrödinger formulated the [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) mathematically: $i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V \Psi$

- Quantum randomness (probability) bothered Eistein: "God is not playing dice". [Quantum nonlocality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality) (~=entanglement) annoyed him as well: "Spooky action at a distance". Einstein ruled out the instantaneous communication because nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.
- However, entanglement and nonlocality proved to be true. It implies that we are bigger than the Gaia scale, we are on the Universe scale.
- Consciousness and the Copenhagen Interpretation
    - Richard Feymann said: "I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."
    - The bizarre duality of the Schrödinger cat, the cat alive and dead at the same time.
    - The cat is in super position with the poison: `decayed/nondecayed isotope <-> alive/dead`
    - Until observation, the quantum particles are in superposition.
- Quantum physics showed the **impossibility of separating the observer from the experiment**.
- Plank said: "I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We can not get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness."

## All the Way Down: Space-Time and the Quantum Foam

> "Space-time is a field inescably rich with energetic fluctuations."

> "Created and annihilated, created and annihilated, what a waste of time."

> "Every action we take, every decision we make, every thought we have, is not only our own, It is also an integrated, intergral part of the whole holoarchical universe. In this sense, when I raise a glass of water to drink, it is the universe that raises a glass of water. If I am alive, then the universe is alive. We are not merely seperate, lonely, disconnected beings searching for meaning; moment by moment we are unique expressions of the universe itself."

> "Oneness is real and true."

- Can we go further down from subatomic particles? Is it *turtles all the way down*?
- Max Plank's answer is no! He figured out that there must be a minimal limit of space and time.
- The smallest possible unit called as [Plank constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant). Space constant is $10^{-36}$ meter, time constant is $10^{-43}$ seconds.
- Space isn't emptiness, it is a 4 dimensional fabric. Space can be bent, stretched, compressed, therefore objects behave differently in it.
- Having said that, we arrive at a fundamental incompatibility.
    - Einstein's equation of relativity consider space.-time smooth, continuous whole.
    - Plank's calculations indicate it is not smooth, it is discrete.
    - This incompatibility yields a nonsensical outcome: *infinite* mass, *infinite* size, *infinite* speed.
- The theory of everything assumes that general relativity is just an approximation.
- Quantum Foam: The fluctuations arise from the matter-antimatter [annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation).
- Feymann described the Quantum Foam as "Created and annihilated, created and annihilated, what a waste of time". But sometimes, *by mere luck*, particles escape annihilation, so *life can emerge*.
- We cannot notice the fluctuation of the quantum realm, yet we feel and touch things, and think that we live in the universe, but actually **we embody the universe**.
- Holoarchy of the Self-Organizing, Complex Universe
    - The universe is constructed by a level of hierarchies (from large to small scale) which are interconnected in a fuzzy manner.
    - The body as a [holon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) (i) everyday scale, (ii) cellular scale, (iii) molecular scale. Our brain comes to rescue and *simplifies* the rich details of molecular/cellular scale.
    - Materialism pushes away this belief, complexity theory welcomes it.

# III. Consciousness

## The "Hard problem of Consciousness"

> "The perceptions of the ordinary human mind therefore inevitably falling short."

- The author picked up another scent to follow than Langton to understand the world. He visited spiritual (e.g. Buddhist) and philosophical ideas. 
- Concepts in [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism)
    - Interdependence: Everything linked to everything.
    - Impermanence: If something can die, it will die.
    - Emptiness: nothing exists, everything is in the process of transformation.
- Studying consciousness is tricky because either it arises with space/time/matter or arises *from below*.
- If I am alive, then the universe is alive? If I am conscious, then the universe is conscious?
- The western world view is that consciousness is in the brain, thus separated from person to person. Other culture link love to the heart, or Buddhists have their own vocabulary for different level of consciousness.
- Does the Brain Make Consciousness or ...?
    - Brain scans show electrical activities to correlate to consciousness. But correlations do not prove that the brain activity causes the conscious experience.
    - For example, wearing glasses in summer and eating ice cream. `correlation != causation`
    - Two hypothesis (i) brain defines mind (ii) brain derives from a shared root. Like the sun, is the shared root in the example of wearing glasses and eating ice cream.
- The Hard Problem
    - Brain-makes-mind does not explain our subjective experience. Seeing a red object, smelling a rose, watching our kids grow, touching loved ones. We can model every single detail, but the experience will differ.
- Philosophical Approaches to Consciousness
    - [Materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism): Consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, *brain-makes-mind*.
    - [Panpsychism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism): Consciousness is an intrinsic feature of all life or not only life but even atoms, *cell-have-mind* or *atom-have-mind*.
    - [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism): Consciousness is an illusory impression arise from within us, *consciousness-is-illusion*.
- Big-C Consciousness
    - In the [allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave), Plato's shadow is small form `f`, real objects are big form `F`. The concepts have ideal Forms like Beauty, Truth, Goodness but once they are interpreted by us by our brain they transform into small form like beauty, truth, and goodness.
    - So there is a small-c, consciousness and there is a Big-C consciousness. Like **waves and the ocean**. Like individual consciousness and the Consciousness.
    - *Consciousness makes the universe, and our brain evolved to perceive a slice of It*.
- Transduction of Consciousness
    - The brain is not a producer of the mind but rather a transducer of the mind. Like light bulb transduce electricity into light, in that process heat generated.
    - Brain transduces Big-C Consciousness into the small-c consciousness.
- None ever answer the hard-problem which leads us to empirical science, philosophy, and religion.

## The Vienna Circle and Scientific Empiricism

> "Quantum mechanics sets a boundary over which science cannot leap."

- Habits make things visible, "fish unaware of the water they move through".
- Science or religion as habit blinds us. Newton was an *exception*, since he practiced both.
- After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, science and art concentrated in Vienna. The [Vienna circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle) (1924-1936) used logic to aid philosophy.
- Metaphysics: Questions that cannot be answered through examination of the materials. For example, *life after death*, the *existence of the soul*, or the *nature of God*.
- As it turned out in the Vienna Circle, science can only answer questions to a limit extent.
- The Limits of Empirical Science
    - Empirical Science: `Theory -> Experiment -> Data -> Prove or Disprove -> Theory -> ...`
    - Quantum mechanics illuminates the limits of empirical science because the **subject** (scientist) and the **object**/process **are** **dependent**. They are influenced by each other.
    - Great thinkers welcome the ambiguity (Bohr, Heisenberg, Plank) while others (Einstein) not.
    - Some kinds of observation alter the features of quantum phenomena, others not.

## Kurt Gödel and the Limits of Formal Logic

> "The highest aim of my life is the pleasure of cognition."

- The proof by formal logic has two major entities:
    - Axioms: Assumed to be true. For example, reflexive `a=a`, symmetric `a=b, b=a`, transitive `a=b, b=c, a=c`.
    - Theorems: Require proving. For example, [Goldbach's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture) $n > 2 \quad n = p + q$, [Riemann Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis) $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad \text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$
- System has to be consistent (no contradiction), complete (every statement is provable), decidable (an algorithm can determine if a statement is true or false).
- Gödel in Vienna
    - Gödel to his Mom at a very young age: "The highest aim of my life is the pleasure of cognition."
    - Is mathematics invented or discovered? It is a little bit of both, *mathematics awaits human discovery*, not human inventions. For example, Schrödinger equation or Mandelbrot set.
- Incompleteness and Intuitions
    - The beauty of his theorems, often compared to Bach's musical cannons.
    - Gödel devised a number system where every number is a logical statement. Arithmetic between numbers is transitions between statements. Logical statement could be about numbers, numbers could be about logical statements.
    - This meta-mathematical and **self-referential** design was genius, just like the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip).
    - He created "This statement cannot be proved from within this system." similar to "All Cretans are liars." which resulted in a paradox, hence a contradiction.
    - Lot of theorems that are true but unprovable.
- [Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) and Intuition
    - Maybe, aspect of the universe *cannot be comprehended by logic* but by the mind.
    - There are **mathematical truths that exist independently of logic**.
- Responses to Gödel: Alan Turing, John von Neumann and others were amazed and inspired by his genius.
- Vienna Diaspora: Nazi Germany chased Jews. Jews traveled to the USA such as Gödel, Einstein, ...
- Gödel in Princeton: He was a professor, but he had deep paranoia, so he did not eat because he thought that the food was poisoned.
- Gödel's meaning of us: *Intuition* and experience within is also *important*, just as empiricism.

## Return of Metaphysics: Fundamental Awareness

> "We hunt for words to give the flavor o the experience of the ineffable, even if the experience is, by definition, beyond description."

> "This whole universe was made in order that God might know Himself. The seed wished to realize what it is, what is in it, and therefore became the tree."

> "It is our training (by neurodevelopment, by instinct, by teaching) that causes us to forget the innocent, but not naive, sense of connection we carry with us from the womb before we enter into a seemingly independent life."

- Meditation: Gaining insight by the mind contemplating itself. For example, mantra, [mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala), open presence, aversion.
- Meditation practitioners give good data for exploring the nature of the mind. Can we justify our subjective experience, our own data points? Is the meditation experience *reproducible*?
- Contemplative Practices as Sources of Knowledge
    - Each and every religion and spiritual tradition focuses on different questions. Buddhist interested in suffering, Jews in God, Christianity in Jesus, and so on.
- Creation and Consciousness
    - Buddhism: Mind of clear light, the desire causes suffering, if objects are empty then there is no attachment. The deepest meditative state **when one's mind not bounded within self** but connected to Everything.
    - Hebrew: Creative potential, how God created and sustains the Universe. Their four words of mystical terminology can be mapped to complex theory terms: `Atziluth - Emanation`, `Beri'ah - Creation`, `Yetzirah - Formation`, and `Assiah - Action`.
    - Vedanta, Hinduism: Nonduality, [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman), the divine reality versus [Ishvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishvara), the personal reality. They see the world as a complementary unit, the God-man, the light-dark, the consciousness-Consciousness.
    - Kashmira: How the universe happens, it speaks the process of existence.
- These four traditions offer complementary description derived from meditation.
- Integration: Fundamental Awareness
    - If we combine complex theory, idealism, metaphysics (spiritualism) then we arrive at the fundamental awareness.
    - The universe is self-organizing, alive and conscious, born from pure awareness. Fundamental Awareness gives rise to a mechanism by which it can recognize itself.
    - As Sufi master Hazrat [Inayat Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inayat_Khan) put it: "This whole universe was made in order that God might know Himself. **The seed wished to realize what it is, what is in it, and therefore became the tree**."
- What can be learned, can be unlearned. What can be lost, can be found.
