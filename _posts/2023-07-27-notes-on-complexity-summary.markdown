This is my summary of the [Notes on Complexity: A Scientific Theory of Connection, Consciousness, and Being](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Complexity-Scientific-Connection-Consciousness/dp/1954118252) book by Neil Theise.

## Introduction

- The author had a several interests through out his lifetime. Started with mathematics and followed by biology and computer science. Later, philosophy and religion got his attention as well.
- He met with a girl who was fascinated in complexity theory. She was amazed by the emergent property of the [TechoSphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechnoSphere_(virtual_environment)) game. It is a real-time simulation, governed by set of rules and algorithms. The game was capable to model concepts such as evolution.
- The interaction between Neil and the girl set the stage for the investigation of complexity.

# I. Complexity

## Science of Being

> "The whole system is greater than the sum of its parts."

- Complexity arises anywhere from deep seas to the Himalaya, but its origin still a mystery.
- Complexity != Complicated, rather the simple parts of a system interact with each other and that give rise to an *evolving*, *adaptive*, and *self-sustaining* properties.
- The newly created properties from the interactions called **emergence**.
- Complexity goes beyond humans and biology. It also applies to technology, chemistry and physics.
- General relativity and Quantum mechanics cannot describe how basic elements transform into complex system. According to [computational irreducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibility), it may be inevitable.
- As babies, we were born as whole. Later, we identify with "I" inside and "the World" outside.
- Humans drawn to the feeling of unity, still busy finding the oness of the world.
- Complexity theory can provide deep insights about how to *be one with all*.

## Order, Chaos and the Origin of Complexity

> "Like our world. Like our life."

- Complexity theory (CT) arose in the 1960s. Before then, the reductionist view was the following: you understand a system by breaking into its pieces and understanding them one by one.
- Complexity theory tells a different story. It is a study of how the individual parts combine/self-organize with each other to make a system. CT reverse the process: `parts -> system` instead of `system -> parts`
- 1st System Class: Precisely Predictable
    - These systems obey to simple equations.
    - For example, fluid mechanics can describe statistically without knowing every single water molecule.
- 2nd System Class: Chaotic System
- Fractals: The Mathematics of Chaos
    - Benoit Mandelbrot expanded our knowledge of chaos theory in 1975.
    - Fractals geometries are present in nature, for instance romansco broccoli, branching rivers, forks of lighting.
    - Fractals in nature reach a limit, yet mathematically we can go on forever. The [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) has no limit to its ever-unfolding characteristic.
    - It is hard to summarize them in a compact equation, for this reason, computers enter into the study of complexity.
- 3rd System Class: Living Organism
    - It is insufficient to describe the living system like the lung, heart, brain by equations. Therefore, scientists apply complex theory.
- Game of Life
    - Christopher Langton (a young hippie and a self-taught programmer) was amazed by the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automaton.
    - It was created by John Conway. The Game of Life is a 2D grid of squares that are living (black square) or dead (white square) depending on the number of living or dead squares around them.
    - Langton realized that cells on the monitor and the cars on the street are both living, are both similar, not different in any kind.
    - He embarked on the path of CT and recognized that is all about the *evolution of the information*. He called the generated pattern by the computer: artificial life.
- Life at the Edge of Chaos
    - Stephan Wolfram came into the game to research the field of complexity further. He identifies (as Langton and John von Neumann did independently) a 4th class, the phase transition.
    - [Phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) is where chaos and stability pull in opposite direction.
    - The four distinct classes are the *Frozen*, the *Blinking*, the *Chaotic*, and the *Complex* class.
    - While chaos theory describes the previously indescribable, the complex theory describes life itself.
    - The models of complexity mimic living things, from ant colonies to global ecosystem.
    - Phase transition between water and ice and steam are depicted as simple lines but looking closely at the boundary reveals the edge of chaos.
    - If you look at trees, fungi, chemicals, insects, humans, then you will see complexity.
    - The adaptations drive evolution toward increasingly more computational capabilities, biological system thereby seem to evolve between order and disorder. Because the information transmission and processing is most effective at [critical point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics)). Evolution leads to complexity.
    - Stuart Kauffman argues best about complexity theory in his "The Origin of Order" book.
    - He went further than Darwin and constructed models (Boolean networks, autocatalytic sets) that explained how life is originated.
- [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) and Unpredictability
    - Unlike traditional theories, complexity and chaos can be explored by computer simulations. Through simulation, new properties emerge magically.
    - Emergence in chaotic system: The whole is *predictably* greater than its parts. If the butterfly flaps its wings the same way, it results with the same tornado.
    - Emergence in complex system: The whole is *unpredictably* greater than its parts. We can predict that emergence will occur, but cannot predict its precise nature, even if we start with the same initial conditions.

## Rules of Complexity and the Adjacent Possible

> "Life is ceasless movoment; stability found in balance, not in rigidity."

> "Explosive growth ensues, followed by utter collapse"

> "Unpredictibality is the defining hallmark of complex systems."

> "Stability and chaos tug at life from either side."

> "Death cleans the way for more extraordinary, unpredictable life. And isn't there more to life than just staying alive? What about the meaning of being part of a larger, ever-evolving whole?"

- Everywhere you look, you see complexity. We are part of it. Let's look at ants!
- Numbers matter. A few ants do not give rise to complexity, they did not create tunnels, food lines, bury their dead and so on.
- **Interactions are local**, not global. The queen ant does not micromanage from top-down, she only reproduces. They produce/communicate using pheromones. Food line is created without any plan.
- Authoritarian regimes practice the illusion of global control.
- Similarly, the brain does not monitor everything. It is part of the beautifully complex web of the human body with the endocrine system, the digestive track, the vascular system, ...
- [Negative Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback) Loops Prevail
    - Negative loop: If the environment is too warm, then the air conditioner cools it down. If the environment is too cold, then the air conditioner warms it up.
    - Positive loop: If the global temperatures rise, then Arctic ice begins to melt. As the ice melts, it exposes more dark ocean water. It absorbs more sunlight than reflective ice, leading to increased warming of the water.
    - Negative feedback loops are common to reach [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis), balanced state. Like, ant scents reinforce each other, but it fades away as time goes by.
    - All living systems are homeostatic.
    - If the positive feedback loop overtake, then equilibrium vanishes. For example, economic bubble or cancer cell.
    - Uncontrolled growth of cancer cell can be cured by resetting the immune system, the homeostasis, the negative feedback loop.
    - On the smaller scale (atom, quantum) is easier to convey the feedback loops, mathematically speaking.
- The Degree of [Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness) is Key
    - Too much randomness prevents self-organization, too less randomness causes *machine-like* behavior.
    - A little randomness (just the right amount) opens the door for adjacent possibilities. That is why complex systems differ, even with the same initial starting point.
    - While a cell talks differently to other cell than a quark talks to another quark, each of them has its own emergent properties. Different level, different communication.
- What makes us alive necessitates that we will die!

# II. Complementarity and Holarchy - Or the Boundless Body

## The Cellular Level: Our Bodies, Our Cells

> "Complex system can be composed of other complex system."

> "Opposites are complementary."

- Everything is made by smaller part, cells. The same kind of cell differ from each other, they exhibit *diversity within the uniformity*.
- Cells self-organize, communication is local, interaction is a little random.
- Whether you see a "thing" or "phenomenon" depends on the scale and on the point of view.
- [Complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity)
    - Is our body unitary or a phenomenon arising? Both, equally and unequally.
    - By the same token, light is both a wave and a particle in quantum physics. The [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) shows the wave-particle duality.
    - It is impossible to capture both state at the same time, hence they are complementary.
    - Niels Bohr saw complementarity as a **fundamental property** at every scale. Bohr has a symbol on his arm to remind himself: "Opposites are complementary."
- Where is your Boundary Now?
    - Touch and feel your finger. It contains dead skin cells and on top of it, bacteria. These bacteria are called microbiome, fellow travel companions who keep us alive.
    - Bodies 50% cell are [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome). We give to them, we get from them, a nice [symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis).
    - Think of your body today, yesterday, when you were a teenager, baby, fetus, fertilized egg, unfertilized egg, the egg of mother's, Homo Erectus, multi-cell, Eukaryote, single-cell, ...
    - We are all a single organism in the continuation of space and time. Meaning, we are independent individuals, yet dependent on one organism.

## The Molecular Level: Beyond the Cell Doctrine

- The cell was a philosophical question in ancient time. The debate was discrete or continuous, atom or fluid. *Again a complementarity!*
- For example, acupuncture is proven its positive health effect, yet we cannot explain by the discrete cell doctrine, but the fluid doctrine provides a useful insight.
- The Fluid Body
    - Cells float in fluid where nutrients and molecular waste are present.
    - Cell membrane, either water-soluble or fat soluble.
    - Warmer temperature leads to more kinetic energy, which then leads to more [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion).
- Bodies are not Machines
    - Muscle movement involves Actin, Myosin, ATP, and water.
    - It is not a molecular machine because water interaction is random.
    - Temperature and Brownian molecule motion affect the cell interactions.
- Consider a man living in the forest. He is self-sufficient, he gathers food from the forest, he disposes his wastes (CO2, urine, feces), wastes are recycled by other organisms that live in the forest
- The same **cycle** can be found in the cities, in everyday **life**.

## The Atomic Level: Gaia

> "Over the last 3.5 billion years, the atoms of Earth are organizing themselves to reach the atoms of Mars."

- Atoms (just like molecules) are self-organized. Sugar $C_6H_{12}O_6$, oxygen $O_2$, water $H_2O$, fat $CH_3(CH_2)_nCOOH$, protein $RCH(NH_2)COOH$
- Atoms fulfill the criteria for complex system: positive/negative feedback loop, local interaction, randomness.
- Molecules (therefore atoms) return to nature. An **endless recycling** and replacement. Hence, we are in fact the Earth itself. Life and Death are a series of transformations.
- [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) considers the planet as a single organism.
- Organic and inorganic components act as a single, self-regulating, living system. They are *not separated*, they are complementary.
