This is my summary of the [Notes on Complexity: A Scientific Theory of Connection, Consciousness, and Being](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Complexity-Scientific-Connection-Consciousness/dp/1954118252) book by Neil Theise.

## Introduction

- The author had a several interests through out his lifetime. Started with mathematics and followed by biology and computer science. Later, philosophy and religion got his attention as well.
- He met with a girl who was fascinated in complexity theory. She was amazed by the emergent property of the [TechoSphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechnoSphere_(virtual_environment)) game. It is a real-time simulation, governed by set of rules and algorithms. The game was capable to model concepts such as evolution.
- The interaction between Neil and the girl set the stage for the investigation of complexity.

# I. Complexity

## Science of Being

> "The whole system is greater than the sum of its parts."

- Complexity arises anywhere from deep seas to the Himalaya, but its origin still a mystery.
- Complexity != Complicated, rather the simple parts of a system interact with each other and that give rise to an *evolving*, *adaptive*, and *self-sustaining* properties.
- The newly created properties from the interactions called **emergence**.
- Complexity goes beyond humans and biology. It also applies to technology, chemistry and physics.
- General relativity and Quantum mechanics cannot describe how basic elements transform into complex system. According to [computational irreducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibility), it may be inevitable.
- As babies, we were born as whole. Later, we identify with "I" inside and "the World" outside.
- Humans drawn to the feeling of unity, still busy finding the oness of the world.
- Complexity theory can provide deep insights about how to *be one with all*.

## Order, Chaos and the Origin of Complexity

> "Like our world. Like our life."

- Complexity theory (CT) arose in the 1960s. Before then, the reductionist view was the following: you understand a system by breaking into its pieces and understanding them one by one.
- Complexity theory tells a different story. It is a study of how the individual parts combine/self-organize with each other to make a system. CT reverse the process: `parts -> system` instead of `system -> parts`
- 1st System Class: Precisely Predictable
    - These systems obey to simple equations.
    - For example, fluid mechanics can describe statistically without knowing every single water molecule.
- 2nd System Class: Chaotic System
- Fractals: The Mathematics of Chaos
    - Benoit Mandelbrot expanded our knowledge of chaos theory in 1975.
    - Fractals geometries are present in nature, for instance romansco broccoli, branching rivers, forks of lighting.
    - Fractals in nature reach a limit, yet mathematically we can go on forever. The [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) has no limit to its ever-unfolding characteristic.
    - It is hard to summarize them in a compact equation, for this reason, computers enter into the study of complexity.
- 3rd System Class: Living Organism
    - It is insufficient to describe the living system like the lung, heart, brain by equations. Therefore, scientists apply complex theory.
- Game of Life
    - Christopher Langton (a young hippie and a self-taught programmer) was amazed by the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automaton.
    - It was created by John Conway. The Game of Life is a 2D grid of squares that are living (black square) or dead (white square) depending on the number of living or dead squares around them.
    - Langton realized that cells on the monitor and the cars on the street are both living, are both similar, not different in any kind.
    - He embarked on the path of CT and recognized that is all about the *evolution of the information*. He called the generated pattern by the computer: artificial life.
- Life at the Edge of Chaos
    - Stephan Wolfram came into the game to research the field of complexity further. He identifies (as Langton and John von Neumann did independently) a 4th class, the phase transition.
    - [Phase transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition) is where chaos and stability pull in opposite direction.
    - The four distinct classes are the *Frozen*, the *Blinking*, the *Chaotic*, and the *Complex* class.
    - While chaos theory describes the previously indescribable, the complex theory describes life itself.
    - The models of complexity mimic living things, from ant colonies to global ecosystem.
    - Phase transition between water and ice and steam are depicted as simple lines but looking closely at the boundary reveals the edge of chaos.
    - If you look at trees, fungi, chemicals, insects, humans, then you will see complexity.
    - The adaptations drive evolution toward increasingly more computational capabilities, biological system thereby seem to evolve between order and disorder. Because the information transmission and processing is most effective at [critical point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics)). Evolution leads to complexity.
    - Stuart Kauffman argues best about complexity theory in his "The Origin of Order" book.
    - He went further than Darwin and constructed models (Boolean networks, autocatalytic sets) that explained how life is originated.
- Emergence and Unpredictability
    - Unlike traditional theories, complexity and chaos can be explored by computer simulations. Through simulation, new properties emerge magically.
    - Emergence in chaotic system: The whole is *predictably* greater than its parts. If the butterfly flaps its wings the same way, it results with the same tornado.
    - Emergence in complex system: The whole is *unpredictably* greater than its parts. We can predict that emergence will occur, but cannot predict its precise nature, even if we start with the same initial conditions.

## Rules of Complexity and the Adjacent Possible

- Everywhere you look, you see complexity. We are part of it. Let's look at ants!
- Numbers matter. A few ants do not give rise to complexity, they did not create tunnels, food lines, bury their dead and so on.
- **Interactions are local**, not global. The queen ant does not micromanage from top-down, she only reproduces. They produce/communicate using pheromones. Food line is created without any plan.
- Authoritarian regimes practice the illusion of global control.
- Similarly, the brain does not monitor everything. It is part of the beautifully complex web of the human body with the endocrine system, the digestive track, the vascular system, ...
- [Negative Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback) Loops Prevail
    - Negative loop: If the environment is too warm, then the air conditioner cools it down. If the environment is too cold, then the air conditioner warms it up.
    - Positive loop: If the global temperatures rise, then Arctic ice begins to melt. As the ice melts, it exposes more dark ocean water. It absorbs more sunlight than reflective ice, leading to increased warming of the water.
