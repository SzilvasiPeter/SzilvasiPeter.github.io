The [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/) is a kind of film that you have to watch more than 3 times. The message, the story, the actings and the imagery symbols are complex and hidden from the viewers. Only if you exceedingly pay attention on the details, you will maybe try to grasp this great movie. Therefore, I myself also watched it three times and researched explanations on the internet which helped a lot to *understand* the Inception. I do not think that I am fully succeed but I developed my own interpretation which I am satisfied with.

I invite you to watch the movie, checkout reddit posts, watch youtube videos (e.g. [Inception in Real-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHBlYJ-tKcs)), go to [Inception Wiki](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Inception_Wiki), and then watch the film again while you are taking notes. If you have **no time to watch** the whole film then refresh your memory by reading the [Inception Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception#Plot) on Wikipedia. Getting know the [main characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception#Cast) will assist to understand the story.

Are you ready? If so, here is my notes on the Inception by Christopher Nolan.

# Notes on Inception

The film unfolds through two inception attempts, revealing Cobb's expertise. In the first, he incepts Saito for the Cobol Engineering company. In the final, he incepts Fischer and attempt to free Saito from the Limbo state.

The movie's opening scene finds Cobb stranded on the Limbo shore. This moment holds a duality: did Cobb attempt to incept Saito to secure his return, or did Saito incept Cobb to join him? While both options are plausible, the latter is more probable since Saito **only tests** Cobb:

> Cobb: So why let us in at all?\
> Saito: An audition.\
> Cobb: Audition for what?\
> Saito: It doesn't matter. You failed.

## Team Building

The team contains six members: an Extractor, a Planner, an Architect, a Forger, a Chemist and a Tourist:

Ariadne (derived from Greek Mythology) joins to Cobb team as the new Architect. Cobb explains dreams mechanics by crafting a dream unknown to her.
> Cobb: Let me ask you a question. You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on.

Dreams blur reality, even inflicting genuine pain. In the dual mirror moment, Ariadne crafts the dream from personal memory. Cobb alerts her to not create dreams with her own memory. Essentially, creating a line where **real and unreal** dissolves.

> Cobb: Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.

The next teammember is Eames. He takes on the role of Forger, expert at imperosnating different personas. He emphasizes the importance of **the simple and emotionally rooted** ideas. He also highlights the fact that the dreamer's idea must look as if he had derived it himself, ensuring the seamless integration of an idea.

> Eames: It’s not just about depth. You need the simplest version of the idea, the one that will grow naturally in the subject’s mind. It's a very subtle art.\
> Eames: We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level.\
> Eames: Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. [Idea] It has to seem self-generated.

Arthur enlightens Ariadne on dream defense through paradoxes like the [Penrose staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_stairs). These paradoxes keep projections at bay and shield the subconscious, preserving dream stability.

Yusuf, the final team member, showcases his potion craft. The drug significantly extends the dream duration. Beneath his shop, slumbering elders reside. The elder watchman notes **their dreams are now their reality**, seeking awakening.

> Yusuf: They come every day. To share the dream.\
> Cobb: How long in dream time?\
> Yusuf: With this compound... about forty hours. Each and every day.\
> Eames: They come here every day to sleep?\
> Elderly Bald Man: No. They come to be woken up... the dream has become their reality...

Most of us have found refuge in some kind of fantasy realm. Be it the pursuit of money and fame, the glow of a television screen, the sanctuary of faith and belief, or the landscapes of our own minds. In any case, we are escaping from our harsh (and fabricated) reality.

In the following scenes, we learned about Fischer's relationship with his father. His father neglected the relationship, focusing solely on money and power. The family picture (playing together with a pinwheel) holds no sentiment even at his deathbed. Fischer can obtain everything from money, except his father love. Likewise, Cobb and Mal are happy together, yet they fixated on the dreaming world. All of them are punished: Fischer's father dies without love, Mal suicides with confusion, and Cobb guilts from his wife's death. The symbol of punishment reoccurs later in the film which is marked by the 491 number. It *may* alludes to the **unforgivable sin** in the Bible.

> Matthew 18: 21-22\
> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"\
> Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."

The $7*70=490$ plus one (the "unforgivable" sin) yields 491. Regarding the number 528, I do not find any significance for it. On the Quora site, someone said that the 582 is the harmonic frequency for the note "mi" (miracle) which the third musical note. It represents the three-level dream state. But it seems no link between the [E (musical note)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(musical_note)) and 528... am I overlooking something? 

Neverthless, I found a more satisfying answer [here](https://qr.ae/pyqOtx).

> The number 528491, `52` means the year when his father Maurice Fischer was born which is 1952, `84` means the years when Robert Fischer was born which is 1984 and `91` means the year when his mother died which is 1991 when Robert was 7 years old.

Who is right? We never know, yet our brains always come up with patterns in order to explain the unexplainable.

## Planning

The team revise a three-level dream plan for inception, prompting Fischer to reject his father's legacy.
- In New York Streets, Yusuf's dream convince Fischer of "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."
- In the Hotel Lobby, Arthur's dream are persuading Fischer to "I will create something myself."
- In snow-covered Hospital Complex, Eames' dreams declares "My father doesn't want me to be him."

Going that deeper to the dream land is not only cumbersome but very dangerous as well.

> Eames: Nah, it's perfectly possible, it's just bloody difficult.

Deviations from the plan push them to the Limbo level, the deepest layer. The place of the **collective unconsciousness** that Cobb and Mal built. Buildings and memories fill this place, including a Japanese palace. The palace that is Saito's manifestation, his **fear of death**. Saito implies multiples times about his struggle with aging, the desire to be youth again.

> Saito: Dare you take a leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?\
> Saito: Then I'll take the chance and come back. And we'll be young men together again.

## First Level

Saito faced with the fear of death when Fischer's projections shot him. It turned out that they were in a deep sleep that if someone died in that dream, they would go to Limbo. Limbo is the rawest state of our unconsciousness, where our demons await. Time slows in this place, making the dreamer prone to illusions such as the dream is real.

Before going deeper into the dream level, they interrogate Fischer to set up the stage for the next level. Eames impersonates Fischer's godfather to gather details about his connection to his father. The conversation makes it clear that Fischer and his father had no meaningful experience together. When Fischer's mother passed away, his father told him that "There's really nothing to be said, Robert." even though his son was only eleven years old. At the end of his deathbed, his last word to his only child was "Disappointed". This word will later be used to incept Fischer.

We also get to know the relationship between Cobb and Mal. Ariadne asks Cobb about Mal. Initially, they were unaware that as they delved deeper into the dream state, they would lose their grasp on reality. Spending 50 years in Limbo changed Mal completely.

> Cobb: To wake from that. From decades lived. To be old souls thrown back into youth. It was hard. At first Mal seemed okay. But I started to realize something was wrong. Finally she admitted it. This idea she was possessed by. This simple little idea that changed everything...\
> Ariadne: What was it?
> Cobb: That our world was not real. No matter what I did, no matter what I said, she was convinced that we were still in a dream. That we needed to wake up again...

Mal had planned her suicide to slander Cobb so that he decided to jump out of the windows as well. She asked him to "take a leap of faith" just like Saito in the beginning. But he was unable to leave his children. Mal's last sentence to Cobb will be reiterated later.

> Mal: You're waiting for a train... A train that will take you far away... You know where you hope this train will take you, you can't know for sure... But it doesn't matter... Because you'll be together...

Cobb had to leave the country to avoid jail, letting his children behind. In his dream, Mal was empowered by the guilt that originates from Cobb's inability to process his traumas.

## Second Level

This level starts with an ingenious trick, the "Mr. Charles" trickery. It is a gambit design where someone goes against their subconsciousness. The plot is the following: Cobb convinces Fischer that he is Mr. Charles, a defender of subconscious projections in his dream because an enemy Extractor pulling out information from him.

> Cobb: My job is to protect you from any attempt to access your mind through your dreams.

Importantly, everything that happening on level one affects everything on level two:

- A raindrop at level one creates a storm at level two
- Curving the van by Yussif on the street of level one changes the whole gravity at the hotel on level two

The purpose of the team is to mud Peter that he wants to get rid of the safe information to get his father's last will. The constructed narrative in which Fischer is unworthy in his father's eyes, that he is not capable of anything by himself, led to go deeper into Peter's (Eames') subconscious. They ended up in room 491 just above the 528 room. Incidentally, the code for the safe (528-491) was there, hidden from the hasty attention. When one is seeking restlessly to resolve a question then realizing that the answer is always present in front of the eyes.

> Ariadne: So you destroy his one positive relationship?\
> Cobb: No. We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather's true nature.

Throughout the mission of level two, Cobb's shadows manifest themselves, reminding him of the loss of Mal. When his wife jumps out of the windows, leaving the family behind. The memory of the children at home where he can not return. The missing feeling of the old days, the sense of emptiness spreads in Cobb's mind.

## Third Level

The most dangerous level is the snow-covered hospital complex. Not only because of Fischer's projections but because of Cobb's, too. By going down into deeper and deeper layers, Fischer just remembers the last dream. The New York City dream is forgotten besides the airplane travel in reality.

> Ariadne: The truth that at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious. And the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you. And I'm not sure we're going to like what we find.

The time dilation is also increases. In order to wake up, they arrange an order of "kicks" in the dreams. Only a falling sensation can wake up the dreamers. In this regard, the kicks have to be synchronized or the dreamer will stay sleeping, unable to wake up:

- First-level kick: Yussif rides the car into the river. The kick will be the bounce of the car when the car falls off the bridge.
- Second-level kick: Arthur explodes the elevator because the gravity is changed during the free falling of the car. The explosion will make the sense of "falling" in the already floating dream. Brilliancy from Arthur...
- Third-level kick: The elevator explosion creates a huge snow avalanche at this level. Eames's kick is another explosion, the denotation of the hospital complex.

The team sieges the fortress where Fischer's father rests to acquire his last will. There is a lot of action and projections killing in the meanwhile. Similar to when the immune system fights against a virus with it's full arsenal. But it does sometimes destroy the healthy cells in that process. Like a belief, an ideology, an *idea* destroys one mind.

> Ariadne: These projections, they're part of his subconscious?\
> Cobb: Yeah.\
> Ariadne: Are you destroying those parts of his mind?\
> Cobb: No, of course not. They're just projections.

Mal appears in this dream as well, sabotaging the mission as usual. Because Cobb hesitates to kill her, she shoots Fischer. Only after that, Cobb is willing to kill the shadow of his wife. Fischer and Mal descend into Limbo.

They almost give up the mission till Ariadne comes up with a brilliant solution: go down to Limbo, find Fischer, and kick him so he can get his father's will. Eames signals for the kick by shocking Fischer with the defibrillator. The brave Ariadne assists Cobb in the Limbo where Mal is waiting for them.

> Ariadne: Your guilt defines her. It's what powers her. But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her. And if we are going to succeed in this, you have to forgive yourself and you're going to have to confront her. But you don't have to do that alone.

## Limbo

Once the world of Limbo was beautiful, flooded with happy memories. Now, it is collapsing. Cobb and Mal built this place for years, reminding them of the joyous events of their life. Cobb is not immune to hallucinating his children in Limbo as well. Rather, the desire to see his children once again is more significant. After the tour of the old memories, they find the building where Mal is imprisoning Fischer. The peak of the movie is tensioned around the dialogue between Cobb and Mal.

> Cobb: There's something you have to understand about me. About inception. You see, an idea is like a virus... Resilient... (turns to Ariadne) Highly contagious, and an idea can grow. The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world...\
> Mal: The smallest idea, such as... "Your world is not real."\
> Mal: A simple little thought that changes everything...\
> Mal: So certain of your world. Of what's real. Do you think he is (points at Cobb) Or do you think he's as lost as I was?\
> Cobb: I know what's real.\
> Mal: What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream? Mutable laws of physics? Tell that to the quantum physicists. Reappearance of the dead? What about heaven and hell? Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah? They crucified Christ, didn't they?\
> Cobb: I know what's real.\
> Mal: No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces? The way the projections persecute the dreamer?\
> Mal: Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me.\
> Cobb: (rising anger) I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us.\
> Mal: You're wrong, Dom. You're confused... our children are here\
> Mal: (whispers) And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom?\
> Cobb: Our real children are waiting for me up above.\
> Mal: (laughs) Up above? Listen to yourself. You judged me for believing the very same thing.\
> Mal: These are our children. Watch. (turns to the kids) Hey, James! Philippa?!\
> Cobb: They're not real, Mal. Our real children are waiting for us.\
> Mal: You keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it.\
> Cobb: I know it.\
> Mal: And what if you're wrong? What if I'm what's real?\
> Mal: You keep telling yourself what you know... but what do you believe? What do you feel?\
> Cobb: Guilt. I feel guilt. And however confused I might get.\
> Cobb: However lost I might seem... it's always there. Telling me something. Reminding me of the truth.\
> Mal: What truth?\
> Cobb: That you were wrong to doubt our world. That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie...\
> Mal: How could you know it was a lie?\
> Cobb: Because it was my lie.\
> Mal: (realizing) Because you planted the idea in my mind.\
> Cobb: Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards...\
> Ariadne: Why?\
> Cobb: We'd become lost in here. Living in a world of infinite possibilities. A world where we were gods. I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world...\
> Cobb: I couldn't make Mal understand that we needed to break free. To die. So I started to search our world...\
> Cobb: Searching for the right place in her mind...\
> Cobb: And when I found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, I broke it open...\
> Cobb: I broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea.\
> Cobb: A truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget...\
> Cobb: That her world was not real.\
> Cobb: That death was a necessary escape.

(Memory of when Cobb and Mal arrive at the train tracks)

> Cobb: You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter...\
> Mal: Because you'll be together.

(Memory ends)

> Cobb: I never thought that the idea I'd planted would grow in her mind like a cancer. That even after we woke...\
> Cobb: You'd continue to believe that your world was not real...\
> Mal: That death was the only escape?\
> Mal: You killed me.\
> Cobb: I was trying to save you, I'm sorry.\
> Mal: You infected my mind. You betrayed me. But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together... right here. In our world. The world we built together.

A huge lighting storm appeared because of the defibrillator sign. The sign for the kick, but Cobb needs to find Saito first. Cobb wishes to be with Mal, that she would live. However, he knows that she does not exist anymore. It is crystallized for him that Mal is just a shade of his real wife.

> Cobb: I wish you were. But I couldn't make you real. I'm not capable of imagining you in all your complexity and... perfection. As you really were. You're the best I can do. And you're not real.

After Cobb refuses to stay with Mal, she stabs Cobb, and then Ariadne shoots Mal. Fischer wakes up after he was pushed down from the building. Then Fischer finds out the disappointment of his father: My father does not want me to be his "shadow". Meanwhile, all kicks are initiated, making the possibility of waking up. Lastly, Mal asks if Cobb remembers what he said after marrying her.

> Mal: We'd be together forever. You promised me.\
> Cobb: I know. But we can't. And I'm sorry.\
> Mal: You remember when you asked me to marry you? You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.\
> Cobb: And we did...

It turned out that they did grow old together. In Limbo. They died as old, not young, when the train hit them.

> Cobb: I miss you more than I can bear... but we had our time together. And now I have to let go...

## Ending

The opening and the ending look the same, but looking carefully, the conversations of the scenes are slightly different from each other. The dialogues are shifted very subtly.

> Saito: I've been waiting for someone to come for me...\
> Cobb: Someone from your half-remembered dream...?\
> Saito: Cobb? Not possible, he and I were young men together. And I am an old man...\
> Cobb: Filled with regret? (Saito remembers, nods...)\
> Saito: Waiting to die alone, yes.\
> Cobb: I came back for you... I came to remind you of what you once knew...\
> Cobb: That this world is not real.\
> Saito: You came to convince me to honor our arrangement?\
> Cobb: Yes. And to take a leap of faith.\
> Cobb: Come back and we'll be young men together again.

Both of them are struggling to remember back to the real world. Slowly, they start to regain their memories back. Who are they, what is real, and what are their agreement? In the end, they took "a leap of faith" which woke them up. Saito was very confused on the plane, but he did arrange a call which has helped Cobb to cross the country border. By crossing the border, he can finally see his children's faces once again.

Cobb was filled with joy after seeing James and Philippa. The intensity of happiness was so much that he had to spin the totem because it felt like a dream. He could not wait for the totem to collapse. He does not care about if it is a dream or not. At the end, the totem started to wobble, hinting that this moment was not a dream. But even if it is a dream, it is meaningless. Why? Because the only thing that matters is that the love towards his children is real.

# Interpretation

The movie encapsulates a lot of symbols: the desire to live in a dream, the aversion from reality, the suicide as solution, the feeling of missing one's children, the lack of parental love, the terror of aging. Maybe, Mal is not died from the "world is not real" idea. But due to an illness, to a cancer or to a virus. In this sense, the mental and physical diseases are interconnected: if you are in peace, your body will be at ease; if you are not in peace, your body will be in disease. Maybe, Cobb is dreaming the whole time in order to process his traumas.

In any case, the film teaches us important lessons. First, that human beings want to live in a dream to lessen the reality of life. Second, that human beings the only animals which can suffer because of their own mind. And third, that there is only one thing that is more painful than dying: witnessing the suffering of a loved one. This is why Cobb wants to go home at all cost. Because his children will feel immense pain once they find out that not only that their mother was died but that they can never see their father anymore.

He steals valuable information from his targets by infiltrating their dreams. Cobb was once a skilled Architect mentored by Professor Stephen Miles, and he fell in love with Miles' daughter, Mal. Unfortunately, he's a fugitive due to false accusations regarding his wife death, leaving him unable to return home. They married and had two children (Phillipa and James), sharing a profound connection. Mal was fascinated by dream sharing but was among the first to recognize its dangers. To anchor herself in reality, she uses a spinning top as his totem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mallorie Cobb (Mal) | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/10/Malinfobox.png" alt="Mallorie_Cobb" width="150"/>              | Shade     | Mal serves as the central the antagonist as a mental projection. Before she commited suicide, she was the wife of Dominick Cobb. This event haunts Dom in his reality and dreams. Their memories suggest a joyful family life, with a deep love between them. Mal introduced the concept of totems first, using a spinning top (now owned by Dom), to maintain a grip on reality within dreams. In Limbo, a dream state, Mal and Dom got stuck and fascinated by its power. Mal eventually lost touch with true reality, leading Dom to plant the idea that her reality was a dream to wake her. Regrettably, this inception left a lasting impact on her perception, even after awakening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Saito               | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/1c/Kenwatanabe_inception01.jpg" alt="Saito" width="150"/>         | Tourist   | Saito joins Cobb's team in their mission who assists in planning by buying an airline for the 10-hour flight. During the initial dream level, the mission takes a turn as Fischer's trained subconscious resists, leading to a car chase where Saito is gravely wounded. The team tries to keep him alive in a warehouse but he eventually dies and comes down into Limbo. In the next level of the dream set in a hotel, Saito's injury improves due to the deeper layer, allowing him to function normally despite the wound. During the last dream level in snow-covered mountains, Saito joins the team at a hospital fortress but his condition worsens from his injury. Fischer's death, resulting from Mal's gunshot, leads to his descent to Limbo. Saito sacrifices himself by using a grenade to eliminate projections, causing him to enter Limbo; Cobb and Ariadne venture into Limbo to rescue Fischer. After Ariadne succeeds and returns, Cobb is left alone to search for Saito. Years later, Cobb washes up on a shore and finds himself in a palace with Saito who aged ninety due to Limbo's time dilation. They gradually recover their past memories. Cobb uses a spinning totem to convey the concept of reality's ambiguity to Saito. They wake from Limbo, likely after having shot themselves. In the end Saito fulfills his promise, letting Cobb reunite with his family via a phone call. |
| Robert Fischer      | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/b/b2/Robert_Fischer_Infobox.png" alt="Robert_Fischer" width="150"/> | Target    | Robert Fischer, the target of Cobb's team, is set to inherit a massive fortune from his dying father, Maurice Fischer. Despite his wealth, Robert is burdened by insecurities, stemming from living in his father's shadow. Cobb seizes this vulnerability for Inception, exploiting Robert's fear of disappointing his father. When Robert was eleven-years-old, the relationship between his father is worsened by the death of his mother. Fischer's sole positive memory of his father is depicted in a photograph of them enjoying a homemade pinwheel, which he places by his father's deathbed, despite his father's lack of recognition. According to Robert, his father's last word for him reflected their entire relationship: "disappointed". In contrast, Robert seems closer to his godfather, Peter Browning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Driven by curiosity, she immerses herself in the job and uncovers the truth behind Cobb's situation. She bravely enters Cobb's dreams to confront his unresolved issues, particularly his projection of Mal. Despite the dangers, she actively participates in the inception mission, displaying her creativity and keen perception, and assists in addressing Cobb's personal struggles. The name [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne) derives from Greek mythology, where she assisted Theseus by using a ball of red thread in the labyrinth of the Minotaur. In the film, Ariadne plays a similar role, guiding Cobb through his subconscious labyrinth and helping him confront his inner demons. She wears red for the majority of the movie that proves her name origin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Locations

The scenes can be divided into four different dream levels plus one reality layer where the characters are awake or sleep.

- Reality: Thoughts and ideas can not alter the laws of physics over here.
- Level 1: Someone is dreaming in reality. The projections defend the dreamer from the extractors. If you sleep ten hours in reality, then a week passes in this level.
- Level 2: Dreaming inside a dream. The dreamer is going to lose the memory of reality. The unconscious manifestations are getting stronger. Ten hours in reality results six months in this place.
- Level 3: The dreamer most likely forget about the level one dream and the reality. Here, the projections are the strongest and the most sophisticated. The rate of time dilation is about 1 year dreaming to 1 hour sleeping.
- Limbo: It is the most dangerous location where the dream has no limitations. Thoughts, ideas and desires are manifesting with no boundary. The dreamer may lose the perception of what is real or not. Time is unpredictable, whereby multiple years or decades can pass in only a session of sleep.

Each dream state has its own distinct catharsis and location. The following tables show the chronological order of the locations based on the levels.
