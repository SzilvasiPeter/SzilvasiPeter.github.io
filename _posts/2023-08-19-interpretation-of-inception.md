The [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/) is a kind of film that you have to watch more than 3 times. The message, the story, the actings and the imagery symbols are complex and hidden from the viewers. Only if you exceedingly pay attention on the details, you will maybe try to grasp this great movie. Therefore, I myself also watched it three times and researched explanations on the internet which helped a lot to "understand" the Inception. I do not think that I am fully succeed but I developed my own interpretation which I am satisfied with.

I invite you to watch the movie, checkout reddit posts, watch youtube videos (e.g. [Inception in Real-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHBlYJ-tKcs)), go to [Inception Wiki](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Inception_Wiki), and then watch the film again while you are taking notes. If you have *no time* to watch the whole film then refresh your memory by reading the [Inception Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception#Plot) on Wikipedia. Getting know the [main characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception#Cast) will assist to understand the story. Go to Fandom wiki page for more information about [Dominick Cobb](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Dominick_Cobb), [Mallorie Cobb (Mal)](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Mallorie_Cobb), [Saito](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Saito), [Robert Fischer](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Fischer), [Ariadne](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Ariadne), [Eames](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Eames), [Arthur](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur), and [Yusuf](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Yusuf).

| Dominick Cobb       | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/2/2b/Dom_cobb.jpg" alt="Dominick_Cobb" width="150"/>                | Extractor | He is the protagonist, his expertise lies in extraction. He steals valuable information from his targets by infiltrating their dreams. Cobb was once a skilled Architect mentored by Professor Stephen Miles, and he fell in love with Miles' daughter, Mal. Unfortunately, he's a fugitive due to false accusations regarding his wife death, leaving him unable to return home. They married and had two children (Phillipa and James), sharing a profound connection. Mal was fascinated by dream sharing but was among the first to recognize its dangers. To anchor herself in reality, she uses a spinning top as his totem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Mallorie Cobb (Mal) | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/10/Malinfobox.png" alt="Mallorie_Cobb" width="150"/>              | Shade     | She serves as the central the antagonist as a mental projection. Before she commited suicide, she was the wife of Dominick Cobb. This event haunts Dom in his reality and dreams. Their memories suggest a joyful family life, with a deep love between them. Mal introduced the concept of totems first, using a spinning top (now owned by Dom), to maintain a grip on reality within dreams. In Limbo, a dream state, Mal and Dom got stuck and fascinated by its power. Mal eventually lost touch with true reality, leading Dom to plant the idea that her reality was a dream to wake her. Regrettably, this inception left a lasting impact on her perception, even after awakening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Saito               | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/1c/Kenwatanabe_inception01.jpg" alt="Saito" width="150"/>         | Tourist   | Saito joins Cobb's team in their mission who assists in planning by buying an airline for the 10-hour flight. During the initial dream level, the mission takes a turn as Fischer's trained subconscious resists, leading to a car chase where Saito is gravely wounded. The team tries to keep him alive in a warehouse but he eventually dies and comes down into Limbo. In the next level of the dream set in a hotel, Saito's injury improves due to the deeper layer, allowing him to function normally despite the wound. During the last dream level in snow-covered mountains, Saito joins the team at a hospital fortress but his condition worsens from his injury. Fischer's death, resulting from Mal's gunshot, leads to his descent to Limbo. Saito sacrifices himself by using a grenade to eliminate projections, causing him to enter Limbo; Cobb and Ariadne venture into Limbo to rescue Fischer. After Ariadne succeeds and returns, Cobb is left alone to search for Saito. Years later, Cobb washes up on a shore and finds himself in a palace with Saito who aged ninety due to Limbo's time dilation. They gradually recover their past memories. Cobb uses a spinning totem to convey the concept of reality's ambiguity to Saito. They wake from Limbo, likely after having shot themselves. In the end Saito fulfills his promise, letting Cobb reunite with his family via a phone call. |
| Robert Fischer      | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/b/b2/Robert_Fischer_Infobox.png" alt="Robert_Fischer" width="150"/> | Target    | Robert Fischer, the target of Cobb's team, is set to inherit a massive fortune from his dying father, Maurice Fischer. Despite his wealth, Robert is burdened by insecurities, stemming from living in his father's shadow. Cobb seizes this vulnerability for Inception, exploiting Robert's fear of disappointing his father. When Robert was eleven-years-old, the relationship between his father is worsened by the death of his mother. Fischer's sole positive memory of his father is depicted in a photograph of them enjoying a homemade pinwheel, which he places by his father's deathbed, despite his father's lack of recognition. According to Robert, his father's last word for him reflected their entire relationship: "disappointed". In contrast, Robert seems closer to his godfather, Peter Browning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Ariadne             | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/1a/Ariadne.jpg" alt="Ariadne" width="150"/>                       | Architect | Ariadne is a Parisian architecture student, is contacted by Dom Cobb to design intricate dream mazes for the Fischer inception mission. Driven by curiosity, she immerses herself in the job and uncovers the truth behind Cobb's situation. She bravely enters Cobb's dreams to confront his unresolved issues, particularly his projection of Mal. Despite the dangers, she actively participates in the inception mission, displaying her creativity and keen perception, and assists in addressing Cobb's personal struggles. The name [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne) derives from Greek mythology, where she assisted Theseus by using a ball of red thread in the labyrinth of the Minotaur. In the film, Ariadne plays a similar role, guiding Cobb through his subconscious labyrinth and helping him confront his inner demons. She wears red for the majority of the movie that proves her name origin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Eames               | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/0/0e/Eames.png" alt="Eames" width="150"/>                           | Forger    | He is an identity thief with the unique ability to imitate others' appearances and behaviors, a skill valuable for the team's deceptions. Resembling J(E)ames Bond, he's charming and flirty with an English accent, often teasing Arthur. Unlike Arthur's technical focus, Eames enjoys the dream world's creative possibilities and has a penchant for extracting people's hidden thoughts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Arthur              | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/6/62/Arthur_Plane_Awake.jpg" alt="Arthur" width="150"/>             | Planner   | Arthur is Dominick Cobb's reliable right-hand man, focusing on practical details while Cobb handles planning.
