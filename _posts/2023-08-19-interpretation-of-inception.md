The [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/) is a kind of film that you have to watch more than 3 times. The message, the story, the actings and the imagery symbols are complex and hidden from the viewers. Only if you exceedingly pay attention on the details, you will maybe try to grasp this great movie. Therefore, I myself also watched it three times and researched explanations on the internet which helped a lot to *understand* the Inception. I do not think that I am fully succeed but I developed my own interpretation which I am satisfied with.

I invite you to watch the movie, checkout reddit posts, watch youtube videos (e.g. [Inception in Real-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHBlYJ-tKcs)), go to [Inception Wiki](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Inception_Wiki), and then watch the film again while you are taking notes. If you have **no time to watch** the whole film then refresh your memory by reading the [Inception Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception#Plot) on Wikipedia. Getting know the [main characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception#Cast) will assist to understand the story. Go to Fandom wiki page for more information about [Dominick Cobb](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Dominick_Cobb), [Mallorie Cobb (Mal)](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Mallorie_Cobb), [Saito](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Saito), [Robert Fischer](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Fischer), [Ariadne](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Ariadne), [Eames](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Eames), [Arthur](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur), and [Yusuf](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Yusuf).

Are you ready? If so, here is my notes on the Inception by Christopher Nolan.

# Notes on Inception

The film unfolds through two inception attempts, revealing Cobb's expertise. In the first, he incepts Saito for Cobol Engineering company. In the final, he aims to free Saito from Limbo state.

The movie's opening scene finds Cobb stranded on the Limbo shore. This moment holds a duality: did Cobb attempt to incept Saito to secure his return, or did Saito incept Cobb to join him? While both options are plausible, the latter is more probable since Saito **only tests** Cobb:

> Cobb: So why let us in at all?\
> Saito: An audition.\
> Cobb: Audition for what?\
> Saito: It doesn't matter. You failed.

Ariadne (derived from Greek Mythology) joins to Cobb team as the new Architect. Cobb explains dreams mechanics by crafting a dream unknown to her.

> Cobb: Let me ask you a question. You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on.

Dreams blur reality, even inflicting genuine pain. In the dual mirror moment, Ariadne crafts the dream from personal memory. Cobb alerts her to not create dreams with her own memory. Essentially, creating a line where **real and unreal** dissolves.

> Cobb: Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.

The next teammember is Eames. He takes on the role of Forger, expert at imperosnating different personas. He emphasizes the importance of **the simple and emotionally rooted** ideas. He also highlights the fact that the dreamer's idea must look as if he had derived it himself, ensuring the seamless integration of an idea.

> Eames: It’s not just about depth. You need the simplest version of the idea, the one that will grow naturally in the subject’s mind. It's a very subtle art.\
> Eames: We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level.\
> Eames: Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. [Idea] It has to seem self-generated.

Arthur enlightens Ariadne on dream defense through paradoxes like the [Penrose staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_stairs). These paradoxes keep projections at bay and shield the subconscious, preserving dream stability.

Yusuf, the final team member, showcases his potion craft. The drug significantly extends the dream duration. Beneath his shop, slumbering elders reside. The elder watchman notes **their dreams are now their reality**, seeking awakening.

>Yusuf: They come every day. To share the dream.\
>Cobb: How long in dream time?\
>Yusuf: With this compound... about forty hours. Each and every day.\
>Eames: They come here every day to sleep?\
>Elderly Bald Man: No. They come to be woken up... the dream has become their reality...

Most of us have found refuge in some kind of fantasy realm. Be it the pursuit of money and fame, the glow of a television screen, the sanctuary of faith and belief, or the landscapes of our own minds. In any case, we escape from our harsh (and fabricated) reality.

In the following scenes, we learned about Fischer's relationship with his father. His father neglected the relationship, focusing solely on money and power. The family picture (playing together with a pinwheel) holds no sentiment even at his deathbed. Fischer can obtain everything from money, except his father love. Likewise, Cobb and Mal are happy together, yet they fixated on the dreaming world. All of them are punished: Fischer's father dies without love, Mal suicides with confusion, and Cobb guilts from his wife's death. The symbol of punishment reoccurs later in the film which is marked by the 491 number. It *may* alludes to the **unforgivable sin** in the Bible.

> Matthew 18: 21-22\
> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"\
> Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."

The $7*70=490$ plus one (the "unforgivable" sin) yields 491. Regarding the number 528, I do not find any significance for it. On the Quora site, someone said that the 582 is the harmonic frequency for the note "mi" (miracle) which the third note of a musical scale. It represents the three-level dream state. But it seems no link between the [E (musical note)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(musical_note)) and 582... am I overlooking something? 

Neverthless, I found a more satisfying answer [here](https://qr.ae/pyqOtx).

> The number 528491, `52` means the year when his father Maurice Fischer was born which is 1952, `84` means the years when Robert Fischer was born which is 1984 and `91` means the year when his mother died which is 1991 when Robert was 7 years old.

Our brains always come up with patterns in order to explain the unexplainable.

The team revise a three-level dream plan for inception, prompting Fischer to reject his father's legacy. In New York Streets, Yusuf's dream convince Fischer of "I will not follow in my father's footsteps." In the Hotel lobby, Arthur's dream are persuading Fischer to "I will create something myself." Eames' dreams in snow-covered hospital complex declares "My father doesn't want me to be him."

Plan deviations push them to the Limbo level, the deepest layer. The place of the **collective unconsciousness** that Cobb and Mal built. Buildings and memories fill this place, including a Japanese palace. The palace that is Saito's manifestation, his **fear of death**. Saito implies multiples times about his struggle with aging, the desire to be youth again.

> Saito: Dare you take a leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?
> Saito: Then I'll take the chance and come back. And we'll be young men together again.

| Dominick Cobb       | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/2/2b/Dom_cobb.jpg" alt="Dominick_Cobb" width="150"/>                | Extractor | Cobb is the protagonist, his expertise lies in extraction. He steals valuable information from his targets by infiltrating their dreams. Cobb was once a skilled Architect mentored by Professor Stephen Miles, and he fell in love with Miles' daughter, Mal. Unfortunately, he's a fugitive due to false accusations regarding his wife death, leaving him unable to return home. They married and had two children (Phillipa and James), sharing a profound connection. Mal was fascinated by dream sharing but was among the first to recognize its dangers. To anchor herself in reality, she uses a spinning top as his totem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mallorie Cobb (Mal) | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/10/Malinfobox.png" alt="Mallorie_Cobb" width="150"/>              | Shade     | Mal serves as the central the antagonist as a mental projection. Before she commited suicide, she was the wife of Dominick Cobb. This event haunts Dom in his reality and dreams. Their memories suggest a joyful family life, with a deep love between them. Mal introduced the concept of totems first, using a spinning top (now owned by Dom), to maintain a grip on reality within dreams. In Limbo, a dream state, Mal and Dom got stuck and fascinated by its power. Mal eventually lost touch with true reality, leading Dom to plant the idea that her reality was a dream to wake her. Regrettably, this inception left a lasting impact on her perception, even after awakening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Saito               | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/1c/Kenwatanabe_inception01.jpg" alt="Saito" width="150"/>         | Tourist   | Saito joins Cobb's team in their mission who assists in planning by buying an airline for the 10-hour flight. During the initial dream level, the mission takes a turn as Fischer's trained subconscious resists, leading to a car chase where Saito is gravely wounded. The team tries to keep him alive in a warehouse but he eventually dies and comes down into Limbo. In the next level of the dream set in a hotel, Saito's injury improves due to the deeper layer, allowing him to function normally despite the wound. During the last dream level in snow-covered mountains, Saito joins the team at a hospital fortress but his condition worsens from his injury. Fischer's death, resulting from Mal's gunshot, leads to his descent to Limbo. Saito sacrifices himself by using a grenade to eliminate projections, causing him to enter Limbo; Cobb and Ariadne venture into Limbo to rescue Fischer. After Ariadne succeeds and returns, Cobb is left alone to search for Saito. Years later, Cobb washes up on a shore and finds himself in a palace with Saito who aged ninety due to Limbo's time dilation. They gradually recover their past memories. Cobb uses a spinning totem to convey the concept of reality's ambiguity to Saito. They wake from Limbo, likely after having shot themselves. In the end Saito fulfills his promise, letting Cobb reunite with his family via a phone call. |
| Robert Fischer      | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/b/b2/Robert_Fischer_Infobox.png" alt="Robert_Fischer" width="150"/> | Target    | Robert Fischer, the target of Cobb's team, is set to inherit a massive fortune from his dying father, Maurice Fischer. Despite his wealth, Robert is burdened by insecurities, stemming from living in his father's shadow. Cobb seizes this vulnerability for Inception, exploiting Robert's fear of disappointing his father. When Robert was eleven-years-old, the relationship between his father is worsened by the death of his mother. Fischer's sole positive memory of his father is depicted in a photograph of them enjoying a homemade pinwheel, which he places by his father's deathbed, despite his father's lack of recognition. According to Robert, his father's last word for him reflected their entire relationship: "disappointed". In contrast, Robert seems closer to his godfather, Peter Browning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Ariadne             | <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/inception/images/1/1a/Ariadne.jpg" alt="Ariadne" width="150"/>                       | Architect | Ariadne is a Parisian architecture student, is contacted by Dom Cobb to design intricate dream mazes for the Fischer inception mission. Driven by curiosity, she immerses herself in the job and uncovers the truth behind Cobb's situation. She bravely enters Cobb's dreams to confront his unresolved issues, particularly his projection of Mal. Despite the dangers, she actively participates in the inception mission, displaying her creativity and keen perception, and assists in addressing Cobb's personal struggles. The name [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne) derives from Greek mythology, where she assisted Theseus by using a ball of red thread in the labyrinth of the Minotaur. In the film, Ariadne plays a similar role, guiding Cobb through his subconscious labyrinth and helping him confront his inner demons. She wears red for the majority of the movie that proves her name origin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Resembling J(E)ames Bond, he's charming and flirty with an English accent, often teasing Arthur. Unlike Arthur's technical focus, Eames enjoys the dream world's creative possibilities and has a penchant for extracting people's hidden thoughts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

His logical and skeptical nature shines through, seen in his creative problem-solving to create a kick in zero gravity. Arthur's technical expertise in the dream world is impressive, explaining complex concepts in simple terms. In Arthur's dream level, Fischer's subconscious seeks him out as the dreamer. Arthur and Ariadne kiss to draw attention away, though the tactic fails but "it was worth a shot".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
